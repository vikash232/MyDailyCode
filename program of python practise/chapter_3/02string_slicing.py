'''basically we gonna learn here how we can cut string and print specific part of list and also print the sequence form 
start and from reverse also it is one of the import part of python'''



# greeting = "good morning,"
# name = "harry"
# print(type(name))
# Concatenating two strings
# print(greeting + name)
# print(c)


# list = ["vikash"]
# print(list[0])
# list.append("raja")
# print(list)
name = "harry"
# print(name[4])
# name[3] = "d" --> Doesn't work

# print(name[1:4])
# print(name[:4]) #is same as name [0:4]
print(name[1:]) #is same as name[1:5]
