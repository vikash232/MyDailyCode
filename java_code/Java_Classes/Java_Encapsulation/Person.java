/*
 * Example explained
 * The get method returns the value of the variable name.
 * 
 * The set method takes a parameter (newName) and assigns it to the name
 * variable. The this keyword is used to refer to the current object.
 * 
 * However, as the name variable is declared as private, we cannot access it
 * from outside this class:
