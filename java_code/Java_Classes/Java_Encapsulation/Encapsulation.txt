The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:

* declare class variables/attributes as private
* provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable


Why Encapsulation?
* Better control of class attributes and methods
* Class attributes can be made read-only (if you only use the get method), or write-only (if you only use the set method)
* Flexible: the programmer can change one part of the code without affecting other parts
* Increased security of data
